# CA-NI-FPPCT

This is a novel encryption scheme named CA-NI-FPPCT, which outperforms the FEPPCT encryption scheme. 

As higher versions of JDK/JRE do not support or suggest computing the size of a Java object directly, ``-javaagent:lib/classmexer.jar`` should be added to the VM commandline. 

Please refer to [https://www.javamex.com/tutorials/memory/instrumentation.shtml](https://www.javamex.com/tutorials/memory/instrumentation.shtml) and [https://www.javamex.com/classmexer/](https://www.javamex.com/classmexer/) for details.
